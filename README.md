# Toxicity Classification of Text Comments

This project focuses on training a deep learning model to classify the toxicity levels of text comments. It utilizes the Jigsaw Toxic Comment Classification Challenge dataset to train the model.

## Installation

To run the code, you need to install the following dependencies:

- TensorFlow
- pandas
- matplotlib
- scikit-learn
- gradio
- jinja2

You can install the required packages by running the following command:

```
pip install tensorflow tensorflow-gpu pandas matplotlib sklearn gradio jinja2
```

## Usage

1. Preprocess the Data:
   - Make sure to download the Jigsaw Toxic Comment Classification Challenge dataset and place the `train.csv` file in the project directory.
   - Run the code to preprocess the data, adapt the vectorizer, and create the TensorFlow dataset.

2. Train the Model:
   - Create a sequential model using the provided architecture.
   - Compile the model with appropriate loss and optimizer functions.
   - Train the model on the preprocessed dataset.

3. Evaluate the Model:
   - Measure the performance of the trained model on the test set using precision, recall, and accuracy metrics.

4. Test with Gradio Interface:
   - Save the trained model as `toxicity.h5`.
   - Load the saved model.
   - Run the Gradio interface to input comments and view the predicted toxicity labels.
